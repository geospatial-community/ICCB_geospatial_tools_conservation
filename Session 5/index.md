## Session 5: Open Source Geospatial Tools for Conservation under Climate Change - a Koala Case Study

# Making Beautiful Maps with QGIS!

Welcome to the QGIS Cartography componment of this course

In this course, we will endeavour to learn about:

-   Establishing efficient workflows for repetitive work using: styles, layouts, templates

-   Cartographic hints and tips

Producing a cartographic product is important to effectively display the results of your investigation. Itâ€™s incredible that ALL of that work can be simply represented, but then, that shows a element of success in your work.

A cartographic product does not just have to be a map with traditional marginalia around it #retro! However it is required sometimes for legislative reasons and reporting to clients when you are in a consulting position. What we are going to produce here is a cartographic product that will display the information you are discussing in a visual sense.
