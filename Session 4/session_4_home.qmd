## Optimiser installation

The prioritizr package requires that you download and install an optimiser - a commonly used one is Gurobi. You can obtain a free academic license for Gurobi here: [https://www.gurobi.com/features/academic-named-user-license/](https://www.gurobi.com/features/academic-named-user-license/). 

Here is a guide to install Gurobi for R: [https://docs.gurobi.com/projects/optimizer/en/current/reference/r/setup.html](https://docs.gurobi.com/projects/optimizer/en/current/reference/r/setup.html). 

Alternatively, if you cannot obtain an academic licence there are other solvers available [https://prioritizr.net/reference/solvers.html](https://prioritizr.net/reference/solvers.html). We recommend installing the CBC solver: [https://github.com/dirkschumacher/rcbc](https://github.com/dirkschumacher/rcbc). 

If you have issues with installing a solver, please let us know.
